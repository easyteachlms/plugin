// This component will contain a title and a post id. and state and inspector sidebar tools that let you define those manually as well (Should be another component)
// It will have a title field and a post selector search box that will filter to the post types you pass in as a prop.

// Should only be used when you have no inner block content or some other conditional like that

const BlockInitialState = ({title, postID}) => {
    // Select A Post
    // What the course title is, and what course is associated with it (for courses that should be easy... or not??)
    // What the lesson title is and what the lesson post its associated with...
    // What the topic title is and what the topic post is associated with.
